Version: 1.5

### Description
This is a masterserver for the quake3 protocol with advanced features:
- copy IP's from other masterservers
- maximum servers per IP
- maximum requests per IP per second
- backup servers to a file which is used to restore IP's on a crash
- clients can request some more information about the master:
    - "ÿÿÿÿmaster": returns e.g. "RPLMaster v1.2"
    - "ÿÿÿÿstats version": returns e.g. "1.2"
    - "ÿÿÿÿstats startup": returns unix timestamp of when the master was startet
    - "ÿÿÿÿstats reqs":    returns number of requests ("ÿÿÿÿgetservers...") since startup
    - "ÿÿÿÿgetservers 16 heartbeaters": only returns servers which heartbeat the master directly (are not copied from another master)

Example servers for JK2 and JKA are running @ master.jk2mv.org
